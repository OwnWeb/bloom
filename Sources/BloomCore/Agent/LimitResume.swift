/// **Asked for as "a button to continue working in a thread when the session limit is reset,
/// based on a timer and a usage check", and both halves are needed.** The timer alone is the reset
/// time the provider stated, and a reset time is a promise about a clock on somebody else's
/// server: sending the moment it passes is sending into a window that may not have turned over
/// yet, and the turn fails again with the same sentence. The usage check alone has no idea when to
/// look. So the resume waits for the latest stated reset of every spent window, and then for a
/// reading of the account taken after that reset which shows nothing spent. The once a minute poll
/// in `QuotaPollSchedule` is what produces that reading, and a resume that is `checking` only
/// nudges the app's one asker, which keeps its own floor.
///
/// **What a limit hit looks like was read from real sessions, not guessed.** Claude Code 2.1.276
/// ending a turn on the five hour window wrote an assistant message saying "You've hit your
/// session limit · resets 11:40pm (Europe/Brussels)" with `apiErrorStatus: 429` and
/// `quotaLimits.status: "rejected"`, and its `result` line carries `api_error_status` on the same
/// terms. Codex states it as `codexErrorInfo: "usageLimitExceeded"` on the failed turn, which
/// `CodexTranslation` carries onto its result as `codex_error_info`. Both are tokens, so nothing
/// here reads anybody's prose, and in particular nothing parses "11:40pm" out of a sentence whose
/// wording and time zone are the CLI's to change.
