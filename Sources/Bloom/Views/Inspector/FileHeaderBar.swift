/// The bar above a file: which file it is, and every choice that applies to this file rather than
/// to the workspace.
///
/// The layout choice and the whitespace choice are bound straight to the same defaults keys the
/// inspector's own toolbar uses, so there is one source of truth per setting and no way for two
/// controls to disagree about what the diff is showing.
///
/// # The controls say what they are
///
/// **Reported by somebody reading a Bloom diff for the first time: this row is a line of glyphs
/// and there is no telling what any of them do.** Six icon-only controls, and the only thing that
/// explained them was a system tooltip about a second and a half away. Both halves of that are
/// answered here and neither of them touches the tooltip delay, which is a setting the person
/// using this Mac owns for every application on it.
///
/// The first answer is the words. `controls` draws each control with its title beside its glyph,
/// and it is the arrangement `ViewThatFits` offers first, so at any ordinary width nothing has to
/// be hovered at all. `compact` is the old glyph row and is what a narrower pane falls back to,
/// and `collapsed` is the overflow menu under that.
///
/// The second is the hint. Every control reports its own sentence into `hint` on hover, and the
/// bar draws it in the slack beside the controls, at once, because a line of text in a row is not
/// a tooltip and has no delay to wait out. See `FileBarHint`.
///
/// The copy is `FileBarControls` in the core rather than string literals here, for the reason that
/// file gives: the one string that was built inline said "Copy the diff" while the pane was
/// showing the file.
///
/// The control cluster collapses into a menu when the pane is too narrow for it. A segmented
/// control and a row of toggle buttons do not truncate: they overflow and get clipped, which is
/// how a control ends up half visible at the edge of a narrow inspector.
